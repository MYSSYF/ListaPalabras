Juno was mad, he knew he'd been had So he shot at the sun with a gun
Shot at the sun with a gun
Shot at his wily one only friend
In the gallows or the ghetto
In the town or the meadow
In the billows, even over the sun
Every end of a time is another begun
You understand, mechanical hands are the ruler of everything
Ruler of everything
I'm the ruler of everything in the end
Do you like how I dance? I got zirconium pants
Consequential enough to slip you into a trance
Do you like how I walk? Do you like how I talk?
Do you like how my face disintegrates into chalk?
I have a wonderful wife, I have a powerful job
She criticizes me for being egocentric
You practice your mannerisms into a wall
If this mirror were clearer, I'd be standing so tall
I saw you slobber over clovers on the side of the hill
I was observing the birds
Circle in for the kill
I've been you, I know you
Your facade is a scam
You know you're making me cry
This is the way that I am
I've been living a lie
A metamorphical scheme
Detective undercover brotherhood
Objective: obscene
Oh no no oh yeah
